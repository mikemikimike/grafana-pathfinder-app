# E2E guide test runner

The Pathfinder CLI includes an end-to-end test runner for interactive JSON guides. It verifies that guide steps function correctly in a live Grafana instance by automating interactions through a real browser.

For prescriptive agent constraints on testing (unit, integration, and E2E), see `.cursor/rules/testingStrategy.mdc`.

This is the canonical implementation-backed reference for E2E CLI behavior. Verify behavior against this document and the source files below before changing code.

## Key concepts

- **DOM-based step discovery**: Tests interact with the rendered UI, not raw JSON. The plugin handles conditional logic; the runner iterates whatever steps are visible.
- **Sequential execution**: Steps run in order, matching the real user flow.
- **Requirements handling**: The runner detects unmet requirements, clicks Fix buttons, and handles skip/mandatory logic.

## Source map for agents

- `src/cli/commands/e2e.ts` — Commander options, input resolution, dependency planning, pre-flight orchestration, clean-stack resets, cloud routing, and per-guide Playwright invocation.
- `src/cli/e2e/e2e-local-package.ts` — local path/journey manifest validation, repository loading, milestone expansion, target gating, and guide hydration.
- `src/cli/e2e/e2e-runner-contract.ts` — environment-variable contract between the CLI process and Playwright runner.
- `src/cli/e2e/e2e-package.ts` — remote package and repository resolution, content fetch, schema validation, side-effect classification, and pre-run skip reasons.
- `src/cli/e2e/guide-chains.ts` — pure package graph planning across hard dependencies, capabilities, and recursive milestones, followed by leaf-guide hydration.

### Input formats

The CLI accepts these input formats:

1. **File paths**: `npx pathfinder-cli e2e ./my-guide.json ./another.json`
2. **Bundled flag**: `npx pathfinder-cli e2e --bundled` (tests all guides in `src/bundled-interactives/`)
3. **Bundled by name**: `npx pathfinder-cli e2e bundled:welcome-to-grafana`
4. **Local package directory**: `npx pathfinder-cli e2e --package ./my-package/` (reads `content.json` + `manifest.json`; add `--repository <path>` for a path or journey)
5. **Remote package ID**: `npx pathfinder-cli e2e --package alerting-101` (guides, paths, and journeys resolve via the recommender; see [Remote package-aware testing](#remote-package-aware-testing))
6. **Remote repository**: `npx pathfinder-cli e2e --remote` (every package in the CDN index)

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0    | All steps passed                          |
| 1    | One or more steps failed                  |
| 2    | Configuration or setup error              |
| 3    | Grafana unreachable                       |
| 4    | Authentication failure or session expired |

## How it works

### Browser viewport

The main Playwright suite and dedicated guide runner use a fixed 1920×1080 Chromium viewport from `playwright.config.ts` and `tests/e2e-runner/playwright.config.ts`. The stable wide viewport prevents responsive layouts from moving common action targets into overflow menus and keeps selector behavior and screenshots consistent across local, CI, and container runs.

### Test execution flow

1. **Pre-flight checks**
   - CLI checks Grafana health via `/api/health` (public endpoint)
   - Playwright validates authentication and plugin installation

2. **Guide injection**
   - Guide JSON written to localStorage
   - Plugin loads guide via `bundled:e2e-test` pattern

3. **Step discovery**
   - Runner scans DOM for interactive step elements
   - Collects metadata: step IDs, skip buttons, Do it buttons, multistep status

4. **Sequential execution**
   - For each step:
     - Check if pre-completed (objectives already met)
     - Handle requirements (Fix buttons with retry)
     - Click "Do it" button
     - Wait for completion indicator
   - Session validated every 5 steps to detect expiry

5. **Reporting**
   - Console output with real-time progress
   - JSON report when `--output` is specified; non-passing runs also write a default report under `--artifacts`
   - Failure artifacts in `--artifacts` directory

## Requirements and skip behavior

The runner follows this decision tree when requirements are not met:

```
Requirements met? → Execute step
    │
    └─ Not met
         │
         ├─ Skippable step → SKIPPED (continue to next step)
         │
         └─ Mandatory step
              │
              ├─ Fix button available → Attempt fix (max 3 attempts)
              │    │
              │    ├─ Fix succeeded → Execute step
              │    │
              │    └─ Fix failed → FAILED (remaining steps marked not_reached)
              │
              └─ No fix button → FAILED (remaining steps marked not_reached)
```

**Skippable steps** (those with a Skip button) allow the test to continue when requirements cannot be met. **Mandatory steps** cause the test to abort on failure, marking remaining steps as `not_reached`.

An unmet read without a Fix button gets a short settle window before the runner treats it as terminal. A visible Fix button is already an actionable settled state. See `Requirements settle window` in the timing table below.

The plugin's requirement check can be mid-transition right after the initial check, or right after a Fix button click. The runner polls briefly for the state to settle, instead of failing on one transient read.
Skipping a step is a two-part handshake, not just a runner-side decision. The runner clicks the plugin's Skip control (the step's always-available Skip button, or the narrower Skip button inside the requirements-explanation banner, whichever the plugin rendered) and waits for the step to reach a terminal state: `completed`, or a successful detach. Only then does the runner record the step as `SKIPPED`. If the plugin never reaches that terminal state, for example no Skip control is found, the click fails, or it stays `requirements-unmet`, the runner records `FAILED` instead of a false `SKIPPED`. A false skip would leave the plugin gated on "Complete previous step" for every step that follows.

A no-op or objective-based step can complete, or its element can detach, between discovery and this point in execution, before the runner even scrolls to it. The runner rechecks for this right before scrolling and records `PASSED`, the same outcome it records when it observes a step completing via objectives right before clicking "Do it". This keeps one DOM state, attached and `completed`, mapped to one outcome, no matter which check in the runner happens to observe it first.

Overall success requires zero mandatory failures and either at least one verified pass or zero failed steps. A run where every step is skipped cleanly succeeds; a run with no verified pass and any failed skippable step fails.

## Artifacts and reporting

### Console output

The runner displays real-time progress with status icons:

- `✓` passed
- `✗` failed
- `⊘` skipped
- `○` not_reached

### JSON report

Use `--output report.json` to generate a structured report:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "outcome": "passed",
  "runner": {
    "name": "pathfinder-e2e-runner",
    "version": "commit-<sha>",
    "nodeVersion": "v24.x",
    "playwrightVersion": "1.61.1"
  },
  "startedAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "endedAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:01.000Z",
  "target": { "url": "http://localhost:3000", "tier": "local" },
  "guide": { "id": "...", "title": "...", "path": "...", "targetUrl": "..." },
  "config": { "timestamp": "..." },
  "summary": {
    "total": 10,
    "passed": 8,
    "failed": 1,
    "skipped": 1,
    "notReached": 0,
    "duration": 1000,
    "mandatoryFailed": 1,
    "skippableFailed": 0
  },
  "steps": [...]
}
```

The report contract's single source of truth is the Zod schema in `src/cli/e2e/schemas/e2e-report.schema.ts`; TypeScript types derive from it via `z.infer<>`, and the runner self-validates every report before writing.

Key contract fields:

- `outcome`: one of `passed`, `failed`, `aborted`, `skipped`, `infrastructure_error`, or `configuration_error`. Multi-guide reports surface `aborted` when any guide's session expired.
- `errorCode`: structured failure code present on non-passing reports. Notable values: `TIER_MISMATCH` (guide requires a different environment tier), `SKIPPED_PREREQ` (a prerequisite guide failed), `REPORT_MISSING` (Playwright exited but wrote no results file), `AUTH_EXPIRED`, `NO_CAPACITY`, `PLAYWRIGHT_SPAWN_FAILED`.
- `guide.contentDigest`: SHA-256 digest of the exact guide content executed
- `guide.sourceUrl`: remote package source URL when available
- `selection`: for an explicitly selected path or journey, the multi-guide report records the root package `id` and `type` separately from its executable leaf-guide reports

### Report validation

The runner always attempts to write a report, even when self-validation fails, so a diagnostic artifact is not lost. A failed validation logs the schema error, writes the original object, and exits with code 2. Consumers must validate the report against the schema matching the producing runner before processing it.

Catchable setup, preflight, provisioning, and Playwright spawn failures still write zero-step reports that validate against the schema. OOM, SIGKILL, and corrupt or missing output remain the worker's responsibility.

Consumers that need a language-agnostic contract can extract the JSON Schema from the CLI, so the artifact always matches the binary that produced the report:

```bash
# from a checkout
npx pathfinder-cli schema e2e-report --include-version

# from the published runner image (self-describing, in-sync by construction)
docker run --rm --entrypoint node ghcr.io/grafana/pathfinder-e2e-runner:commit-<sha> \
  /app/dist/cli/cli/index.js schema e2e-report --include-version
```

The emitted schema carries a stable `$id` (`https://grafana.com/schemas/pathfinder/e2e-test-report-<version>.json`) and `x-schema-version`. Pin consumers on the image digest plus `schemaVersion`.

The `e2e-report` and `e2e-multi-report` schemas are **open-world**: the exported JSON Schema does not include `additionalProperties: false`. This means additive optional fields introduced in a newer runner version are non-breaking — an orchestrator validating reports from a newer runner against an older schema copy will not reject the report. Consumers should configure their validators accordingly (for example, ajv's default behavior already allows extra fields unless explicitly set to strict mode). The `guide`, `manifest`, and other non-e2e schemas remain strict.

Runs that execute more than one guide, or execute an explicitly selected path/journey with one milestone, write a multi-guide report with aggregate summary fields plus the individual per-guide reports.

The dedicated `Dockerfile.e2e-runner` image contains the matching Playwright runner and Chromium, runs as a non-root user, and is published as a signed immutable `ghcr.io/grafana/pathfinder-e2e-runner:commit-<sha>` tag. Cloud Run Jobs should pin the resulting image digest rather than a mutable tag. The deterministic `always-passes` and `always-fails` package fixtures under `tests/e2e-runner/fixtures/` exercise the contract and artifact paths.

### Failure artifacts

When a step fails, the runner captures:

- **Screenshot**: `{stepId}-failure.png` of the viewport
- **DOM snapshot**: `{stepId}-dom.html` for selector debugging
- **Console errors**: `{stepId}-console.json` when the step records console errors

Artifacts are saved to the `--artifacts` directory (or a temp directory by default). With `--always-screenshot`, the runner also captures pre-step screenshots, success screenshots, and a final screenshot. `--trace` records a Playwright trace in a retained per-invocation output directory and surfaces the trace path in CLI output. Non-trace Playwright output directories are removed after each invocation. Trace capture is disabled for bearer-token-authenticated cloud runs because Playwright traces can contain authorization headers, cookies, and temporary credentials.

## Guided-block test guide

To verify guided-block support (substep loop, comment box contract, completion), run the E2E CLI against a guide that includes at least one guided block. The bundled guide **Block editor tutorial** (`block-editor-tutorial`) contains a guided block with two highlight substeps and is skippable:

```bash
npx pathfinder-cli e2e bundled:block-editor-tutorial
```

Or by path:

```bash
npx pathfinder-cli e2e src/bundled-interactives/block-editor-tutorial/content.json
```

Guided steps are discovered via `data-targetaction="guided"` and `data-test-substep-total`; after "Do it", the runner drives substeps using only the comment box (`data-test-action`, `data-test-reftarget`, `data-test-target-value`) and step state (`data-test-step-state`, `data-test-substep-index`). Full coverage (button, highlight, formfill, hover, noop, skippable) may require additional guides such as `prometheus-grafana-101` or `loki-grafana-101`.

## Framework test guide

The bundled guide `e2e-framework-test` validates the E2E runner itself. It follows strict principles:

- **No side effects**: Read-only operations only (no data creation/modification)
- **No dependencies**: Works on a fresh Grafana instance with defaults
- **Fast execution**: Completes in under 60 seconds
- **Deterministic**: Produces the same result every run

Run it to verify your setup:

```bash
npx pathfinder-cli e2e bundled:e2e-framework-test
```

## Dependency-aware ordering

Before running, the CLI builds an execution plan from a `repository.json` index (the bundled `src/bundled-interactives/repository.json` by default, or `--repository <path>`). Guides linked by a hard `depends` prerequisite are run in dependency order and grouped into **chains**; unrelated guides form independent single-guide chains.

- **Auto-included prerequisites**: if you test a guide whose prerequisite is not in the selection (for example `bundled:loki-grafana-101` alone), the missing prerequisite (`prometheus-grafana-101`) is pulled in from the repository and run first.
- **Virtual capabilities**: a `depends` target may be a capability name; it resolves to whichever guide `provides` it.
- **Failure propagation**: if a prerequisite fails, its dependents in the same chain are marked skipped (`prerequisite failed`) and not run; the runner continues with the next chain.
- Only `depends` forms a chain. `recommends` and `suggests` are advisory and do not affect ordering. A `depends` cycle is a configuration error.
  An explicitly selected `path` or `journey` recursively expands its `milestones` into executable leaf guides:

- Milestones run in declared order and share one environment, including nested paths/journeys.
- A metapackage or milestone can declare normal CNF `depends`, including a dependency on another path/journey or a virtual capability provider.
- Milestone order is not an implicit hard dependency. If a milestone fails, later milestones continue unless their resolved `depends` includes the failed guide or metapackage.
- A hard dependency on a metapackage requires all of that metapackage's executable leaves to pass before the dependent package can run.
- Missing milestones, incompatible targets, and cycles crossing `depends` and `milestones` fail before Grafana provisioning or Playwright execution.
- The metapackage cover `content.json` is not executed; only leaf guides are sent to Playwright.

This ordering applies to every run. `--clean` additionally isolates each chain in its own environment (see below).

## Clean-slate runs (`--clean`)

The `--clean` flag boots a dedicated, isolated docker-compose stack (project `pathfinder-e2e`, Grafana on `:3010`) for the test run and tears it down at the end — the normal local dev stack on `:3000` is never touched. Use it when residual state from prior runs is making failures hard to attribute, or when you want clean-slate guarantees across a `--bundled` sweep.

The environment is reset **between dependency chains**, not between every guide. Guides within a chain share one environment so a prerequisite's state survives for its dependents. For example, the bundled `prometheus-grafana-101 → loki-grafana-101` chain runs as `docker up → prometheus-grafana-101 → loki-grafana-101 → docker down`, with no reset between the two guides.

## Timing and timeouts

| Constant                   | Value            | Purpose                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base step timeout          | 30s              | Maximum time for a single step                                                              |
| Multistep bonus            | +5s per action   | Added for each internal action in multisteps                                                |
| Guided substep bonus       | +30s per substep | Added for each substep in guided blocks                                                     |
| Button enable wait         | 10s              | Wait for sequential dependencies                                                            |
| Fix button timeout         | 10s              | Per fix operation                                                                           |
| Max fix attempts           | 3                | Retry limit before giving up                                                                |
| Requirements settle window | 1s               | Poll budget before an unmet read with no Fix button counts as terminal                      |
| Scroll into view           | 5s               | Bounds scrolling a step into view, so a step completing or detaching there can't hang       |
| Late completion check      | 2s               | Bounds the pre-scroll recheck for a step that completed or detached since discovery         |
| Skip sync                  | 5s               | Bounds waiting for the plugin to reach a terminal state after the runner clicks Skip        |
| Guided reload wait         | 15s              | Bounds waiting for `domcontentloaded` after a detected reload or navigation mid-guided-step |

Examples:

- A multistep with 5 internal actions gets a 55s timeout (30s base + 5×5s).
- A guided block with 3 substeps gets a 120s timeout (30s base + 3×30s).

The calculated step timeout is a hard deadline for the complete step operation. If the deadline expires, the runner closes the page and fails the guide.

During step execution, the runner also watches for page crash, page close, context close, and browser disconnect events. An unexpected event stops the active work and writes an `infrastructure_error` report with completed prior steps.

These outcomes use report schema `1.0.0`. They do not add new report error codes.

## Troubleshooting

### Grafana not reachable (exit code 3)

```
❌ Pre-flight check failed: Grafana not reachable at http://localhost:3000
```

**Solutions:**

- Ensure Grafana is running: `npm run server`
- Check the URL is correct: `--grafana-url http://your-grafana:3000`
- Verify network access if using a remote instance

### Authentication failure (exit code 4)

```
❌ Session expired: Auth check returned 401
```

**Solutions:**

- For local development, restart Grafana to reset the session
- For CI, ensure auth credentials are valid

### Step timeouts

Steps may timeout if:

- The Grafana UI is slow to respond
- Network requests take too long
- The step action triggers heavy operations

**Solutions:**

- Use `--trace` to generate a trace file for debugging
- Use `--headed` to watch the browser execution
- Check the DOM snapshot in artifacts for state at failure

### Configuration error (exit code 2)

```
❌ Guide validation failed
```

**Solutions:**

- Run `npm run validate` to check guide JSON syntax
- Ensure the guide file exists and is valid JSON
- Check that the guide follows the required schema

## Environment variables

These variables are consumed by the CLI or passed to the spawned Playwright process. You generally do not need to set runner variables directly — the CLI sets them from its own flags and defaults.

| Variable                | Description                                                                    | Default                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `GUIDE_JSON_PATH`       | Path to JSON guide file                                                        | Required                |
| `GRAFANA_URL`           | Grafana instance URL                                                           | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `STARTING_LOCATION`     | Same-origin path where the guide should begin (set from manifest or `/`)       | `/`                     |
| `AUTH_STATE_FILE`       | Per-guide Playwright storage-state path for form-login auth                    | Temporary CLI path      |
| `E2E_VERBOSE`           | Enable verbose logging                                                         | `false`                 |
| `E2E_TRACE`             | Generate Playwright trace file                                                 | `false`                 |
| `ABORT_FILE_PATH`       | Path where the runner writes abort reason metadata                             | Temporary CLI path      |
| `RESULTS_FILE_PATH`     | Path where the runner writes step results for JSON reporting                   | Temporary CLI path      |
| `ARTIFACTS_DIR`         | Directory for screenshots, DOM snapshots, and related artifacts                | `/tmp/pathfinder-e2e-*` |
| `ALWAYS_SCREENSHOT`     | Capture screenshots on success and failure                                     | `false`                 |
| `E2E_TRACE_OUTPUT_FILE` | Path where the runner records the generated Playwright trace artifact location | Temporary CLI path      |

For cloud targets, pass `--cloud-instance-admin-token host=ENV_VAR_NAME`; the named env var contains an admin service-account token for that exact host. The env var name is user-defined, for example `GRAFANA_PLAY_ADMIN_TOKEN`.

## Error classification

When a step fails, the runner assigns an error classification to help with triage:

| Code                 | Classification   | Notes                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND` | `unknown`        | Could be content-drift OR product-regression |
| `ACTION_FAILED`      | `unknown`        | Needs human triage                           |
| `REQUIREMENT_FAILED` | `unknown`        | Could be content-drift OR missing setup      |
| `TIMEOUT`            | `unknown`        | Could be content, product, or performance    |
| `NETWORK_ERROR`      | `infrastructure` | Definitely environmental                     |
| `AUTH_EXPIRED`       | `infrastructure` | Definitely environmental                     |

Only high-confidence network, authentication, browser-crash, and closed-target failures are auto-classified as `infrastructure`. Selector, action, requirement, and step timeout failures default to `unknown` and require human triage.

The implemented classifier lives in `tests/e2e-runner/utils/guide-runner/classification.ts`.

### Result triage boundary

The CLI produces local execution results, JSON reports, and artifacts. It does not own fleet scheduling, guide-health aggregation, artifact retention, metrics emission, alerting, or recommendation suppression; those concerns belong to the backend guide-health platform.

Use CLI output to determine where the fix belongs:

| Failure type   | Typical signal                                                         | Likely owner                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Content drift  | A selector, requirement, or guide step no longer matches Grafana UI    | Guide/content author                       |
| Product change | Grafana behavior changed and the guide still describes valid behavior  | Product owner or shared selector contract  |
| Runner issue   | The CLI, Playwright runner, or `data-test-*` contract misreports state | Pathfinder CLI/E2E runner implementation   |
| Infrastructure | Grafana, auth, networking, pool capacity, or environment setup failed  | Test environment or guide-health operators |

When the failure is not clearly a runner or contract bug, avoid changing Pathfinder code just to make a guide pass. Update the guide, the test environment, or the backend guide-health platform instead.

## Remote package-aware testing

The CLI can resolve published guides instead of reading local files, then test them against the configured Grafana instance.

- **By ID** (`--package <id>`): when the `--package` value is not an existing local directory, it is treated as a bare package ID and resolved through the recommender (`--resolver-url`, default `https://recommender.grafana.com`). Guides run directly. Paths and journeys expand recursively from the CDN `repository.json`, then fetch and run their leaf guides.
- **Whole repository** (`--remote`): fetches the CDN `repository.json` (`--repo-url`, default the public package repository) and tests every leaf guide in the index. Dependency-aware chaining still applies. Metapackages are not expanded implicitly in a repository sweep; select one explicitly with `--package`.

Guides are routed by their manifest's `testEnvironment.tier`:

- `local` (or no tier) guides run against `--grafana-url`.
- `cloud` guides run against `--cloud-url` (default `https://learn.grafana.net/`), or against `https://{instance}/` when the manifest declares a host-only `testEnvironment.instance`. Shared-stack runs require an admin token explicitly associated with that host via `--cloud-instance-admin-token host=ENV_VAR_NAME`; isolated-stack runs require pool manager config instead.

Cloud auth:

- **Admin token per cloud target.** Pass `--cloud-instance-admin-token learn.grafana.net=GRAFANA_LEARN_ADMIN_TOKEN` to associate an admin service-account token env var with a cloud target. The CLI uses that admin token only to mint a fresh service account and short-lived token for each dependency chain; the browser runner receives only the minted token. Repeat the flag for each supported instance.
- **Isolated stack leasing.** Pass `--cloud-stack-pool-manager-url <url>` and `--cloud-stack-pool-manager-token <env>` to let unsafe cloud dependency chains lease disposable Grafana Cloud stacks from the pool manager instead of the shared target. Pass `--cloud-stack-pool-id <id>` matching the pool configured on the pool manager you are targeting; the CLI default is `nightly`. The CLI sends `POST /v1/leases` before a dependency chain, runs all cloud guides in that chain against the returned `grafanaUrl` and `runnerToken`, then sends `POST /v1/leases/{leaseId}/retire` during teardown.

Per-chain service-account isolation mirrors how `--clean` resets the local docker stack per chain. Minted tokens carry a TTL, and accounts orphaned by crashed runs are swept on the next run. This isolates per-identity state (preferences, stars, sessions) between chains; it does **not** reset org data such as dashboards or data sources created by guides.

Pool-manager stack routing is used when pool manager config is present for any cloud dependency chain that is classified as `possibly_mutating`, `mutating`, or `unknown`, or whose target host has no matching `--cloud-instance-admin-token`. Read-only chains with a matching admin token keep using the faster shared-stack service-account path; read-only chains without one route through the pool manager rather than being skipped.

### Pool-backed cloud runs

The pool manager leases from a **hot pool**: a set of pre-warmed Grafana Cloud stacks that already exist before the runner asks for one. Hot-pool leases are immediate when capacity is available because the manager returns an existing stack URL and a runner token. The runner requests leases with `fallbackPolicy: "hot_only"` and does not concern itself with how the pool manager fulfills or replenishes that pool.

Pool-backed run behavior:

- A configured but unreachable pool manager fails the run during setup with a pool-manager request error. The runner does not silently fall back to a shared cloud stack for unsafe chains.
- `--cloud-stack-max-wait-seconds` is sent to the manager as the maximum lease wait budget. If the budget expires, the manager should return an error such as `no_capacity` or a timeout-specific code; the affected chain is reported as failed.
- Each successful lease is retired with `POST /v1/leases/{leaseId}/retire` during teardown. If the runner crashes before teardown, the pool manager recovers the orphaned lease through its TTL-based expiry, currently one hour.
- When pool capacity is exhausted, CI should treat the result as infrastructure capacity exhaustion, not content drift. Operators should increase hot-pool capacity, free stuck leases, or retry after capacity recovers.

### Known gaps and follow-up

- Interactive SSO/Okta login (driving the identity provider's login UI) is not supported.

### Package outcomes

In remote modes a package can end in one of these states. `failed`, `provisioning_failed`, and `validation_failed` produce a non-zero test-failure exit; `auth_expired` produces the auth-failure exit. Other skipped outcomes are logged and the batch continues.

| Outcome                       | Meaning                                                        | Test failure? |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `passed` / `failed`           | The guide ran (see step results)                               | `failed` only |
| `provisioning_failed`         | Cloud target provisioning or pool-manager leasing failed       | **Yes**       |
| `skipped_tier_mismatch`       | `cloud` guide on a `local` environment                         | No            |
| `skipped_no_auth`             | `cloud` guide with no matching cloud auth                      | No            |
| `skipped_invalid_instance`    | manifest `instance` is not a bare hostname                     | No            |
| `skipped_unsafe_shared_stack` | Cloud guide requires an isolated stack, but none is configured | No            |
| `resolution_failed`           | Recommender returned 404 or a network error                    | No            |
| `fetch_failed`                | Could not fetch `content.json` from the CDN                    | No            |
| `unsupported_type`            | Repository sweep encountered a non-guide composition package   | No            |
| `prerequisite_failed`         | A required prerequisite could not be resolved or run           | No            |
| `skipped_prereq`              | A prerequisite in the same dependency chain failed             | No            |
| `validation_failed`           | Fetched `content.json` failed guide schema validation          | **Yes**       |

With `--output`, pre-run skips are recorded under a `preRunSkipped` array, and each tested guide's report carries package metadata (`packageId`, `tier`, `instance`, `targetUrl`, `sourceUrl`).
